# Energy_Production_prediction Project

## Overview

The Gradient Boosting Regression Project is a machine learning project that focuses on predicting [target variable] using the Gradient Boosting Regression algorithm. The model is trained on a [describe the dataset] dataset to achieve accurate predictions.

## Features

- **Gradient Boosting Regression**: Utilizes the GradientBoostingRegressor from scikit-learn to build an ensemble of decision trees for regression.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV are employed to find the optimal hyperparameters for the model.
- **Model Evaluation**: The project evaluates the model using mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared score on a test set.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required packages (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/gradient-boosting-project.git
cd gradient-boosting-project
pip install -r requirements.txt

python train_model.py

python save_model.py
